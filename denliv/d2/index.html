            <p>Counter-Strike is the most popular shooter game in the world, and it has been for quite some time.
                Despite the fact that CS:GO had been out for over ten years, the game was still reaching new player

                any bigger, Valve announced CS2. With the game now released, we can only imagine the highs that the
                world’s most popular shooter franchise will reach.</p>
